Changelog:
Version 1.0:
Here's version 1.0 of Heavenfall.
This is a completely solo dev project made over the course of 2 days (15 total hours) for the UWaterloo Game Jam, Oct 2024
The functionality is very basic at the moment, but i'm looking to add the following features in the future:
- Enemy Variety
- Boss Fights
- Tutorial
- More Demons
- Better Animations
- More visible descriptions for everything
- Artifacts (special powerups you gain each time you win an encounter)
- Deck Building (you start with only a few quasits, and each win lets you pick a new card to add to your deck)

Tutorial:

Welcome to Heavenfall, you are a blasphemous cultist, looking to become all powerful. You set your sights on the heavens, and prepare to kill God.
You have a deck of cards containing magical sigils which you can use to summon powerful Demons
- To summon a demon, you must expend mana equal to its cost by dragging it from your hand onto the field infront of you.
- When a demon is summoned, you can click on it, and then an enemy, drawing an arrow between the two indicating that the enemy is targeted
- Whenever you are done with your turn, press the end of turn button
- The demons will then attack their targets. If any remain, the targets will attack back at random demons.
- If all demons are dead and an enemy begins an attack, they instead target you, dealing damage to your health.
- If your health drops to 0, you die and the game is over
- If you kill all of the enemies, you win and progress to the next encounter, adding a random new demon to your deck
- If neither happens, you draw a card from your deck, your mana refills and increases in maximum by 1, and you play again
